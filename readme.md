# **183 JS file count**
---
### My name is **Bogdan** and I am trying to save all data structures and algorithms problems that i have been able to solve over the years or while I am learning new stuff.
#### Problems will vary in difficulty and from where they are. Their parent folder will indicate the source.
1. All problems will be solved with JS
2. Files **DO NOT** guarantee that there is only 1 problem inside.
3. Problems will vary in difficulty. They will include the text of the problem. Their parent folder will indicate the source.
4. At each push to repo, **a new .md file will be generated** to display the **current amount of JS files**, roughly indicating how many solved problems there are.
